- 👋 Hi, I’m @SableTheRed
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, games development, and learning C#
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Not sure yet, sort of swamped with things to do at the moment
- 📫 How to reach me ... I don't know how this works yet, I'm new to github... I'll update if I find a way i'm comfortable with.
